# Onboarding

This repository contains a template for a Home Assistant configuration project. It provides 
- a starting point and examples
- a dev environment to review changes
- setup scripts for automatic deployment
- llm development tools

When adding new code or making significant modifications, always consult the [Home Assistant documents](../dev/docs/llms.txt) to find the appropriate syntax for the changes you want to make. 

When responding to a user question or explaining code, cite the documentation when appropriate. 

Keep configuration files single purpose and simple and include them from other files.
